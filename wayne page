I really need someone to help  me, I have tried and tried to find this information and an getting  nowhere. I saw an article on Microsoft automatic connectivity using  hardware id database collected using windows OS in  late July or August. Now I cannot find it. Does anyone have a copy? 
On  an Msdn forum I also saw that Microsoft had deleted three articles or  posts on this topic. If anyone has one or all of these posts, please let me know or send them to me. 
Or if you can help me hack the Msdn database for these articles.
Please email me. pagewayne@sbcglobal.net
Thanks so much.
